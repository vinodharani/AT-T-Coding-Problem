# AT&T Coding Problem

Some notes to the person who is reviwing the code

1. Getting the url from the user and not reading from a property file
2. I wrote the method that uses the url to request a JSON array, but it is commented.
3. I wrote another method that mocks the response JSON array and this is used to find the total.
